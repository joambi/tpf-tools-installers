Install tpf-tool-advanced
---

The 'tpf-tool-advanced' corresponds to the previous basic idea of TPF tools for eLearning the 'tpf-tool-basic' and 'tpf-tools-intermediate'.advanced stands for modularly structured application possibilities for eLearning and Performances (simple to quite complex settings).The most important addition is the possibility to create a 3D audio mix for headphones (binaural) as well as for speakers (ambisonics). Audio and video are independent of each other. Ultragrid can but does not have to be used.
